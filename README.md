This repository contains a collection of shell scripts and C programs related to basic operating system functionalities. Each experiment is organized into separate folders (Exp 1 to Exp 8). Here's a brief overview of each experiment:

### Exp 1: Basic Calculator

- Script: `basicCalculator.sh`
- Description: This shell script implements a basic calculator functionality allowing users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Exp 2: Combinations and File Comparison

- `combinations.sh`: Generates all combinations of the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
- `fileCompare.sh`: Compares two input files and determines if they are the same.

### Exp 3: End of Script and Reverse Number

- `endOfScriptAtEND.sh`: Allows the user to input lines into a file until they type "end" or "END."
- `reverseNumber.sh`: Reverses a user-input number.

### Exp 4: Head and Tail Commands

- `scriptOfHead.sh`: Simulates the head command of bash.
- `scriptOfTail.sh`: Simulates the tail command of bash.

### Exp 5: Directory Management

- Script: `Exp5.sh`
- Description: Manages directories with features such as listing directories, creating directories, modifying directories, and navigating.

### Exp 6: Database Management System (DBMS)

- `database.txt`: Database file to store student details.
- `DBMS.sh`: Manages student details in the database, allowing for addition, deletion, and modification.

### Exp 7: Fork Process in C

- File: `Exp7.c`
- Description: C code demonstrating the use of the fork system call to create child processes and obtain process IDs.

### Exp 8: Custom Grep Command

- `grep.c`: A C program replicating the grep command in Linux.
- `test.txt`: A sample text file with 10 lines for testing the custom grep command.

##### How to Execute Grep Command:
- Compile the `grep.c` file.
- Run the compiled executable with the following commands:
- `./grep test.txt contains life` (to find lines containing "life").
- `./grep test.txt notcontains life` (to find lines not containing "life").
- `./grep test.txt print` (to print the entire text file).
